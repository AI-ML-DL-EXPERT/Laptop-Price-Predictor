# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and screen size. The project utilizes a dataset of laptop listings to train and evaluate the predictive model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (laptop prices).
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests for price prediction.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Laptop_Price_Prediction.ipynb` to view the data analysis and model implementation.
4. Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset of laptop listings. The dataset contains information about various laptop attributes and their corresponding prices.
